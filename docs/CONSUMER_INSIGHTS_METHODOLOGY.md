# Consumer Insights & Market Opportunity Methodology

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the analytical framework used to identify under-served market segments in the local dining sector. By correlating consumer demographic data with transaction patterns and review sentiment, we isolate high-impact opportunities for revenue growth.

## 2. Segmentation Strategy
We move beyond basic demographics to behavioral clustering:

### A. High-Value Frequent Diners ("The Loyalists")
- **Definition:** Top 10% of customers by frequency (>3 visits/month) and spend (>1.5x avg ticket).
- **Indicators:** Consistent weekend ordering, high beverage attach rate.
- **Strategic Value:** Retention is 5x cheaper than acquisition. Target with loyalty perks.

### B. Price-Sensitive Students ("The Value Seekers")
- **Definition:** High frequency but low average ticket size.
- **Indicators:** Lunch special dominance, zero alcohol/beverage spend, coupon usage.
- **Strategic Value:** Volume drivers. Fill tables during off-peak hours (11 AM - 3 PM).

### C. Occasional Celebrators ("The Whales")
- **Definition:** Low frequency (<1 visit/2 months) but massive ticket size (>3x avg).
- **Indicators:** Large party sizes (6+), premium menu items, weekend evenings.
- **Strategic Value:** Revenue spikes. Requires "perfect" service execution to ensure return.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis Logic
We employ a tiered Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to unstructured review data:

1.  **Tokenization & Cleaning:** Removing noise (stopwords, punctuation).
2.  **Aspect-Based Sentiment Extraction:**
    *   *Food Quality:* "Tacos", "Salsa", "Freshness"
    *   *Service Speed:* "Wait time", "Server", "Slow"
    *   *Ambiance:* "Noise", "Music", "Decor"
3.  **Polarity Scoring:** Assigning -1 (Negative) to +1 (Positive) scores per aspect.

## 4. ROI Estimation
By shifting the marketing mix to target "The Loyalists" and optimizing staffing for "The Whales", we project a **15% increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS)** and a **12% lift in quarterly revenue**.
